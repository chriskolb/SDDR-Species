# Installation

Since the repository is still private, clone the repository to your
local machine and either install the package locally or use
``` r
devtools::load_all("davidruegamer/deepregression")
```
which is often more reliable due to some open issues.

# Requirements

The requirements are given in the `DESCRIPTION`. If you load the package manually using `devtools`, make sure the following packages are availabe:

  - Matrix
  - dplyr
  - keras
  - mgcv
  - reticulate
  - tensorflow
  - tfprobability

If you setup a Python environment for the first time, install `reticulate` and run the `check_and_install` function from the `deepregression` package. This tries to install miniconda, TF 2.0, TFP 0.8 and keras 2.3, which seems to be the most reliable setup for `deepregression` at the moment.
